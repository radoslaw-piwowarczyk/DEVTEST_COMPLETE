# DEVTEST

---

Application is divided into two tasks and operating on List of Integers.


## General Information

---

- Task 1 purpose was:
```
The input is a long list of integers. Please write a small app that will output the list of distinct elements sorted in ascending order,
plus the basic measurement information that contains the number of elements in the source, number of distinct elements, min and max value.
```
The output should look like this:
```
1 2 5 10 20
count: 6
distinct: 5
min: 1
max: 20
```

- Task 2 purpose was:
```
Provide a working code that will find all the pairs (in this integer list) that sum up to 13. Each pair in the output 
should have first number not greater than the second one and lines should be sorted in an ascending order.
```
The output should look like this:
```
0 13
3 10
6 7
6 7
```

- Task 3 purpose was:

```
The first line of input contains a positive number n, next n lines contains pairs of positive integers, where each pair identifies a connection between two vertices in a graph. Please provide a working code that will
give us the answer for the following questions: how many separated graphs are in the input.
```
For the input:
```
3
2 3
1 2
5 6
```
The output should be:

```
2
```
## Project Status

Project is: incomplete but created in a way that it is open for future extension, upgrade and development.
There is a room for one more task which given the limited time frame I wasn't able to finish in time.
